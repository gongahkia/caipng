You are a senior full-stack developer tasked with creating a complete web application called "cAI-png" - a Parklane cai fan dish recommendation system. Generate all necessary code, documentation, and setup instructions for this multi-day learning project.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Build a full-stack application where users upload photos of cai fan dishes, the system analyzes ingredients using computer vision, and recommends optimal dish combinations based on dietary preferences and nutritional factors.

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Frontend: React.js with modern hooks
- Computer Vision: OpenCV.js or TensorFlow.js for image analysis
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- File Upload: Multer middleware
- Image Processing: Sharp for optimization
- Authentication: JWT tokens
- Styling: Tailwind CSS or Material-UI

DAY 1 - PROJECT SETUP & BACKEND FOUNDATION:
1. Initialize Git repository "cAI-png" with proper .gitignore
2. Create project structure:
   ```
   cai-png/
   ├── backend/
   │   ├── src/
   │   │   ├── controllers/
   │   │   ├── models/
   │   │   ├── routes/
   │   │   ├── middleware/
   │   │   ├── utils/
   │   │   └── config/
   │   ├── uploads/
   │   └── package.json
   ├── frontend/
   └── README.md
   ```
3. Set up Express server with basic middleware (cors, body-parser, morgan)
4. Configure MongoDB connection and basic error handling
5. Create dish and user models with nutritional data schemas
6. Implement file upload endpoint with Multer for image handling

DAY 2 - COMPUTER VISION & IMAGE ANALYSIS:
1. Integrate OpenCV.js or create TensorFlow.js model for dish recognition
2. Create image preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize, enhance)
3. Implement dish identification service that recognizes common cai fan items:
   - Vegetables: bok choy, cabbage, kangkung, broccoli
   - Proteins: chicken, pork, fish, tofu, egg
   - Starches: rice, noodles
4. Build nutritional database with calories, macros, and health scores
5. Create analysis controller that processes uploaded images and returns identified dishes
6. Add confidence scoring for dish recognition accuracy

DAY 3 - RECOMMENDATION ENGINE & API ENDPOINTS:
1. Design recommendation algorithm considering:
   - User dietary preferences (vegetarian, low-carb, high-protein)
   - Nutritional goals (weight loss, muscle gain, balanced)
   - Budget constraints
   - Flavor balance and variety
2. Create API endpoints:
   - POST /api/upload - Image upload and analysis
   - POST /api/analyze - Process image and identify dishes
   - POST /api/recommend - Generate meal recommendations
   - GET /api/dishes - Retrieve dish database
   - POST /api/preferences - Save user dietary preferences
3. Implement recommendation logic with scoring system
4. Add data validation and error handling for all endpoints

DAY 4 - REACT FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT:
1. Set up React app with create-react-app
2. Create component structure:
   - ImageUpload: drag-and-drop interface for photos
   - DishAnalysis: display identified dishes with confidence scores
   - PreferenceForm: user dietary and nutritional inputs
   - RecommendationDisplay: show suggested dish combinations
   - NutritionSummary: display macro breakdown and calories
3. Implement state management with useReducer or Context API
4. Add responsive design with mobile-first approach
5. Create loading states and error handling UI components

DAY 5 - INTEGRATION & USER EXPERIENCE:
1. Connect frontend to backend APIs with fetch/axios
2. Implement real-time image preview and analysis feedback
3. Add user preference persistence (localStorage initially)
4. Create interactive recommendation cards with:
   - Dish images and names
   - Nutritional information
   - Cost estimates
   - "Add to meal" functionality
5. Build meal summary view with total nutrition and cost
6. Add share functionality for recommended meals

DAY 6 - ADVANCED FEATURES & OPTIMIZATION:
1. Implement caching for frequently analyzed dishes
2. Add image optimization and compression
3. Create dish rating and feedback system
4. Implement search and filter functionality for dishes
5. Add meal history and favorites features
6. Optimize computer vision model for better accuracy
7. Add progressive web app (PWA) capabilities

DAY 7 - TESTING, DEPLOYMENT & DOCUMENTATION:
1. Write unit tests for backend controllers and services
2. Add integration tests for API endpoints
3. Create frontend component tests with React Testing Library
4. Set up deployment configuration for platforms like Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Railway/Render (backend)
5. Create comprehensive README with:
   - Setup instructions
   - API documentation
   - Architecture overview
   - Future enhancement ideas
6. Add environment configuration for development/production
7. Implement monitoring and error logging

SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Include detailed comments explaining computer vision algorithms
- Provide example API requests/responses in JSON format
- Create seed data for initial dish database (at least 50 common cai fan dishes)
- Implement proper error boundaries and validation
- Add TypeScript types for better code quality
- Include Docker configuration for easy local development
- Create automated testing pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implement rate limiting and basic security measures

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Generate complete, production-ready code for all components, including:
- Complete backend server with all endpoints
- Full React frontend with all components
- Database models and seed data
- Configuration files and environment setup
- Testing suites
- Deployment scripts
- Comprehensive documentation
- Package.json files with all dependencies

Ensure all code is well-commented, follows best practices, and includes error handling. Provide setup instructions that a developer can follow to run the project locally within 10 minutes.
